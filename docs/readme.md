# High-traffic WordPress migration for MySchleppApp (HESA Solutions GmbH)

This `docs` folder contains the documentation of the migration project.

The file [2017-08-19-hesa-solutions.md](2017-08-19-hesa-solutions.md) contains the report of the migration and the joint hackfest of HESA Solutions and Microsoft. It's written to understand all important steps of the migration and to know possible sources of errors.

If you want to reproduce the migration you can clone this project. One thing you have to fill with your own data is the subdirectory `wp` of the Docker folder with your own WordPress deployment you want to migrate to Azure Web App for Container.
